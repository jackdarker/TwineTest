<h1>Infos to the games structure</h1>
- data is stored in objects appended to window.story.state
- those objects hae to be plain objects/arrays without function because of saving/restore by json (see guide)
- see Inventory how a workaround is done around this

- functions that are used through the game are appended to window.gm (gm for game)
- you can also add more objects to window for better structuring

<h1>About the styling</h1>
- styling should be preferably done in style.twee or a .css
- but there are some places in twee/js where style-propertie is set directly



<h1>States and Attributes</h1>

States can apply Modifiers to Attributes.

States can be applied to Characters by:
- Enviroment: onTick	f.e. Toxic Air -> Poisoned
- Skills: onUse, onApply	f.e. cast Firewall -> self reduce mana over time, enemys damage over time
- Items: onUse, onTick
- Equipment: onEquip, onUnequip,onTick
- Perks: onGain, onLoose

States are separated from their origin, f.e. Healing over time continues while the Healing-Item is already gone.
- in this case they have to keep track on their own and remove themself

States can Stack: each equipment of armor add their own modifiers to the defense. A individual modifier is removed when a single part is removed.
- need to keep link which State caused which modifier
- States have an ID: Boots:DefenseBonus,  HealthPotion:HealthRecover
- Modifiers store this ID

States can Mutate: a state can change itself, f.e. infected to infested after duration

States can Override other States: Poison Resist also removes Poisoned
