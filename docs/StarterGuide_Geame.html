<h1>Infos to the games structure</h1>
- data is stored in objects appended to window.story.state
- those objects hae to be plain objects/arrays without function because of saving/restore by json (see guide)
- see Inventory how a workaround is done around this

- functions that are used through the game are appended to window.gm (gm for game)
- you can also add more objects to window for better structuring

<h1>About the styling</h1>
- styling should be preferably done in style.twee or a .css
- but there are some places in twee/js where style-propertie is set directly
